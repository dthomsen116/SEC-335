1. Review the excerpt of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) found at https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030

Deliverable 1.  Write a paragraph or two on how you think those conditions should be interpreted by Pen-Testers and what measures must testers have in place to avoid violating the CFAA.
