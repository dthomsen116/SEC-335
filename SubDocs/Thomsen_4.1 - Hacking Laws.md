## 1) Review the excerpt of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) found at https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030. Write a paragraph or two on how you think those conditions should be interpreted by Pen-Testers and what measures must testers have in place to avoid violating the CFAA.

It begins by describing simply that knowingly accessing a computer without authorization (or exceeding authorized access) is a violation of the CFAA. This rule also forbids the taking of any data that requires authorized permissions to access (financial records, information from any US agency or department, information from protected computers, etc). It also lists many measures that the Pen-Testers must keep in mind when testing. Pen Testers must:

> - Not knowingly and with intent to defraud, access a protected computer without authorization
 
> - Never knowingly use code or programs that intentionally causes damage. 

> > - This also includes the act of accessing a protected computer without authorization, causing damage (intentionally or not). 

> - Never use their "power" in order to extort people or threaten damage. 

**Failure to follow these rules can lead to years of prison, fines, etc.**

## 2. Vermont's state law (Title13 Crimes, Chapter 87 Computer Crimes) is much more straightforward: http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/fullchapter/13/087. With particular attention to Sections 4102-4105: Write a paragraph or two on how you think those conditions should be interpreted by Pen-Testers and what measures must testers have in place to avoid violating Vermont Title 13.

Similarly to the CFAA, Vermont Title 13 begins by stating what Unauthorized access means in regards to Pen-Testing, and states the basic definitions as well and forewarnings. It describes that accessing a computer without lawful authority and access is open to legal consequences. It then goes further into detail about what specifically Pen-Testers should keep in mind in order to avoid violating Title 13.

> - Pen Testers are not able to access a protected computer with intents to defraud, obtain money/property/services using fraud, damaging files or devices.

> - Similar to the CFAA, violating Vermont's Title 13 can result in fines, jailtime, etc.

> - Sections 4104-4105 cover the rules around damaging/stealing/destroying computers, networks, files, services, etc. The Pen Tester is unable to intentionally damage or harm any of these, and even if done unintentionally, can result in a legal penalty. Fines for this can go up to $25,000.
